                            <p>I am an accomplished and versatile bioinformatics leader with over 20 years of experience at the intersection of computational biology, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. My expertise spans cancer informatics, biomarker development, gene therapy, and the design of scalable genomic workflows to drive scientific discovery and therapeutic innovation.</p>

                            <p>Throughout my career, I've consistently advanced drug discovery pipelines from concept through development by integrating diverse data types—including RNA-Seq, WES/WGS, single-cell, ATAC-Seq, ChIP-Seq, proteomics, and functional screens—with cutting-edge analytics. I bring deep technical fluency in machine learning, omics integration, cheminformatics, and visualization of large-scale biological data, supported by a strong foundation in statistics.</p>

                        <div class="about-full" style="display: none;">
                            <p>Currently at <b>Spark Therapeutics</b>, I lead the Computational Biology and Machine Learning team to support gene therapy research and technical development. This includes managing automated NGS characterization workflows, enabling single-cell and bulk data analytics, and building novel ML capabilities to enhance platform efficiency and scientific discovery.</p>

                            <p>Previously at <b>GSK</b>, I led data strategy and workflow development for translational oncology, championing AI/ML-driven biomarker and drug discovery approaches. At the <b>Children's Hospital of Philadelphia</b>, I headed the bioinformatics team supporting pediatric cancer research, co-developing major community platforms like PedcBioPortal and Cavatica, and leading initiatives for target discovery and compound sensitivity.</p>

                            <p>Earlier roles at <b>Novartis</b> allowed me to build foundational platforms and pipelines for expression analysis, compound profiling, and target identification across oncology, immunology, and neuroscience, collaborating with academic and industry partners alike.</p>

                            <p>My leadership philosophy centers on empowering thoughtful, independent individuals who thrive in collaborative environments. I focus on removing obstacles that hinder their progress, actively supporting their growth and success, and creating a culture of accountability and trust. I engage closely with stakeholders and senior leadership to stay aligned with evolving company goals and industry dynamics, and I translate these shifts into clear, actionable strategies for the team. My goal is to foster an environment where people can do their best work—while ensuring that the team remains agile, aligned, and purpose-driven.</p>
